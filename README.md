<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Planning

## ERD

**Inspiration**

One of the primary reasons our team decided on this topic is our shared passion for coffee. As coffee enthusiasts ourselves, we wanted to channel this passion into a project that would not only be technically challenging but also personally fulfilling.

**Landing Page**

Users will land on a home page that showcases the essence of our coffee products, and by click 'Coffee' button to start exploring our products.

**Product Selection and Filters**

- Users can easily browse through our diverse collection of premium coffee beans each accompanied by enticing descriptions and visuals of the product.
- We will provide powerful search and filtering options, enabling users to quickly find their desired coffee based on roast level, origin, and more.

**Oauth/Login**

- Users will be able to sign up via Google OAuth.

**Profile Page**

- The user will have a profile page where they can see all of their past orders.

## Biggest Challenge

The toughest part of this project was to link multiple models developed by different engineers, and ensure minimal impact was had on other developers' code.

Mobile responsive design was especially difficult, going forward, we would implement mobile responsive designs first.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Mistakes / Bugs

- **Bootstrap trappings** Whilst bootstrap made implementing styling quicker, it made custom styling especially difficult, particularly when it came to mobile responsive design.

- **GitHub Push and Pull Requests** As a team, early on, it was difficult to stay out of each others code and resolve conflict issues, but with practise and time, this became significantly easier.

- **OAuth google** If a user is using multiple accounts with similar names, google OAuth can be blocked.

## Key Learnings & Wins

- **GitHub Deployment Requires Constant Communication** \
  While it was our first experience working as a team, we encountered and overcame various challenges during this project. These hurdles, though initially daunting, ultimately contributed to our growth and development. <br>
  <br>
  Our success depended on our hard works and close collaboration to align the deployment process with our project's objectives. This experience underscored the importance of teamwork and effective communication. <br>
  <br>
  This project served as a valuable learning experience, laying the foundation for future successes. It showcased our dedication, adaptability, and shared passion for creating a team project. <br>
  <br>

- **Daily-Use E-commerce App Creation** \
  We successfully developed a practical e-commerce app tailored for everyday use. Our focus was on simplifying and enhancing users' daily shopping experiences. This achievement demonstrates our commitment to creating innovative solutions that fit seamlessly into people's lives.
